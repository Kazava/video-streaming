		<h1>Video Streaming</h1>
		<p>The video streaming is based on the client server principle.
		It transfers the information via TCP as well as a UDP. TCP is most
		likely used for the controller functions and UDP for the real time
		video streaming. The client is supposed to provide a user friendly
		interface for the selection of different videos as well as a video
		player for watching them. Additional features like changing the
		color range to improve chroma subsampling, different video stream
		resolutions, different video compressions and a optional
		zig-zag-scan.
